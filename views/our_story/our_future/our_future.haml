%h1 Our Future
%p
  One of our major goals for the future is to continually improve the way we grow our products. 
  We want to expand to meet the priorities of our valued customers, 
  but stay small enough to continually maintain the quality of our product.

  Here at Daniels Produce getting better at what we do will always come before getting bigger.
%p
  Every winter we attend vegetable conferences across the country to discover new varieties of 
  seed and growing techniques to provide our customers with the newest and best products available on the market.
%p
  We plan to improve efficiency of wholesale, retail and production divisions. We have 5 full-time, year-round, 
  employees so someone is always available to answer any questions you might have about our business.
