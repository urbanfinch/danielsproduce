%h1 Our Family
%p
  Tannie and I were married in the fall of 1975 and two years later we were blessed with our first child Holly. 
  As our knowledge for farming began to grow, so did our family. 
  Jason was born in 1979 followed by the youngest, Kelly in 1982. 
  Our kids learned the meaning of hard work early, and spent every hot and sticky 
  summer tending to the family vegetable crops and helping their mother sell 
  produce at the Columbus retail stands.

  Holly obtained a Bachelors degree in Veterinary Science and a Masters in the same field 
  from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. She is now married to Kevin Klink and has 
  three beautiful daughters Anistyn, Taryn, and Avery. Holly works at Pfizer Animal Health 
  as a Scientist and Kevin is Site Manager for Harris Labs. They reside in Raymond Nebraska, 
  but both work in Lincoln, NE.

  Jason earned his Fine Arts degree from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, and is now our 
  General Manager of Production. He still maintains his passion for art as a free lance artist 
  during our short off season.
