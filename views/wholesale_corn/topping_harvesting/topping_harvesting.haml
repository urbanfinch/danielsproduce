%h1 Topping & Harvesting

  Topping is performed three to four days prior to harvest to allow for quick and easy handpicking.

  We only pick the primary ear and leave the second ears because of the possibility of lesser quality. 
  This is the only way to guarantee a beautiful product inside and out.
